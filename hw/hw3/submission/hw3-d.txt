The idea of having a DBMS on the cloud is very appealing since multiple people can work on the same database from anywhere.
This allows companies to scale-up quickly.
However, there could be privacy issues if the company has access to your database.

Additionally, my personal experience shows that it can be inconsistent.
For example, my problem 4 and 5 queries executed in a range of time.
The range of execution time varied from 6 minutes to 11 minutes on the exact same code.
Although the output was the same, getting different time for same code was confusing and a bit frustrating.
I am not quite sure if it's because of my inefficient query or my connection.

Overall, I believe this exposure to the cloud DBMS was very educational and useful.
